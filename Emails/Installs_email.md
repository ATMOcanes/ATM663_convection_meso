Dear Class, 

* Git and github and the github desktop client: 
https://github.com/MPOcanes/MPO624-2020/blob/master/GITHUB_QUICKSTART.md

* Jupyter/Python/Conda install (in the form of Anaconda or Miniconda) 
https://github.com/MPOcanes/MPO624-2020/blob/master/INSTALL_JUPYTER_UNIDATA.md

* Our class repo (note ATMOcanes not MPOcanes).
https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM663_convection_meso

* My presentations on about this software universe 
https://github.com/MPOcanes/MPO624-2020/tree/master/presentations


* My project. Has some demo videos, terse and verbose instructions, yet still feels somehow clumsy and dense to me. 
How I wish I could entice people to install its environment, try its examples, report any troubles! 
Who better than students :)
