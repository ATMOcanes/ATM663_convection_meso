## Folder of resources (readings, links, software, etc.) 

* For a physics-flavored view of the fundamentals, try Dave Raymond's graduate [convection class at New Mexico Tech](http://kestrel.nmt.edu/~raymond/classes/ph536/index.xhtml)

* For computer assignments, you should install the nightly build of the IDV (and then add Mapes IDV collection Plugin), and Anaconda or miniconda. 

* My **Short course on atmospheric convection** book chapters are in the folder here
